I"¬<p>You may need to split the work into a series of slices â€“ each slice should be doable in a single sprint and cumulatively build to the finished product.</p>

<p>Successful products are a careful compromise between features, cost (time) and quality. When scoping a project itâ€™s fine to reduce features or cost, but never quality.</p>

<p>For example if your deadline has been brought forward or development is taking longer than estimated, itâ€™s better to cut some features than to plough on regardless and end up delivering an unfinished product. Work with your team to decide which features are essential and which ones are nice-to-haves.</p>

<p>As long as what you ship is of high quality, no-one will know or care that you had to cut some features to make the release. And you can always go back and add them in later.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Join a scoping session with your team.</li>
  <li>Get alignment on the smallest solution that makes progress toward your idea.</li>

<p>MVPs can be dangerous as they often donâ€™t consider the user experience. They sometimes end up hurting the project as theyâ€™re so stripped back they can be unpleasant to use.</p>

<p>Instead,Â instead think about making a minimum lovable product â€“ the smallest possible solution <em>that also provides a great customer experience</em>.</p>
