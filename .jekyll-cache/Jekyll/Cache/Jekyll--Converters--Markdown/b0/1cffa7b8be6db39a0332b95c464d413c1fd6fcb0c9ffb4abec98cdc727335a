<h3 id="prioritising-assumptions">Prioritising assumptions</h3>

<p>Lean UX is all about doing the most important things first. Once we’ve got our list of assumptions, we need to prioritise them by the level of risk and how much we know about the issue. The more damage getting things wrong could do and the less we know about the issues, the more vital it is we tackle it first.</p>

<p>It’s worth keeping a backlog of all your assumptions however, as even if they didn’t make the first cut, you might want to come back and test them later.</p>
