I"Y<p>Lean UX helps teams understand how the product they‚Äôre building benefits - or doesn‚Äôt beneift - the user. The goal is to quickly and collaboratively explore the problem space and create a shared understanding of the best features to build.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to other software development processes which focus on shipping features, but are not necessarily concerned in shipping ones users actually want or need.</p>

<h2 id="foundations">Foundations</h2>

<p><strong>Design  thinking</strong> ‚Äì every aspect of a business can be approached with design methods.</p>

<p><strong>Agile software development:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
  <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
  <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
  <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lean Startup method.</strong> Lean Startup uses a feedback loop called ‚Äúbuild-measure-learn‚Äù to minimise project risk and get teams building and learning quickly.</p>

<p>Principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-Functional teams</li>
  <li>Small, Dedicated, Colocated</li>
  <li>Progress = outcomes, not output</li>
  <li>Problem-Focused teams</li>
  <li>Removing Waste</li>
  <li>Small Batch Size</li>
  <li>Continuous Discovery</li>
  <li>Test sooner</li>
  <li>Shared Understanding</li>
  <li>Anti-Pattern: Rockstars, gurus, and ninjas</li>
  <li>Externalizing Your Work</li>
  <li>Making over Analysis</li>
  <li>Learning over growth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcomes-assumptions-and-hypotheses">Outcomes, assumptions, and hypotheses</h2>

<p>The Lean UX process treats all ideas, suggestions, things which you ‚Äòknow‚Äô as a designer, things managers and stakeholders ‚Äòknow‚Äô etc. as assumptions, i.e. beliefs that can be proven true or false through data and experimentation.</p>

<p>There are four types of assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Business outcomes</strong>. This is what done looks like. How do you know your product was successful?</li>
  <li><strong>Users.</strong> The people you‚Äôre creating your product for. Who are they? What‚Äôs their persona look like?</li>
  <li><strong>User outcomes.</strong> This is what your users want from your product. What are their pain points? How can your product solve them?</li>
  <li><strong>Features.</strong> How you will improve your product going forward in order to give your users the desired outcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>From your assumptions, you‚Äôre going to then move onto creating a hypothesis. This involves turning your assumptions into hypotheses statements.</p>

<p>This is quite a radical mindset change ‚Äì by treating all ideas as probably false</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on what you ‚Äì or anyone else involved ‚Äì thinks should be done</p>

<p>focuses on the Most software processes focus on features and deliverables.</p>

<p>Where most software creation processes focus on features and deliverables, Lean UX shines a light on the outcomes of the product and how they benefit (or don‚Äôt benefit) the user.</p>

<p>To create good outcomes, Lean UX shifts away from what designers think is required of a product to their assumptions.</p>

<p>Assumptions are simply your belief or expectation based on what you know about your users.</p>

<p>Yes, these are filled with risk and can be outright wrong. But they‚Äôre important to create a launching point for your team.</p>

<p>Example: We believe our users are middle-aged homemakers who need help with their housework. We will know we‚Äôre right if we see an increase in app usage and hear that it has helped them save time on housework.</p>
