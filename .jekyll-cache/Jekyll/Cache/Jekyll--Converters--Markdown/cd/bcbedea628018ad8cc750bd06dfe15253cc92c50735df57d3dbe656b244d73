<p><strong>Hold a retrospective.</strong> This is where you reflect with your team on what worked and what didnâ€™t, and make plans for future improvements.</p>

<p><strong>Track performance.</strong> Keep track of your projectâ€™s performance, measuring it against the KPIs you developed at the start of the project.</p>

<p>Share the results with your team and the wider business. If theyâ€™re good, celebrate your work. If theyâ€™re not so good, share your learnings along with recommendations â€“ maybe others can avoid making the same mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Plan the next phase.</strong> Itâ€™s likely you had to cut the scope to the bone to get the project launched, and thereâ€™s still lots of things that you and the team would like to add.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t leave these ideas languishing on a Trello board somewhere. Plan in when youâ€™re going to return to the project, adding missing features and paying back technical and design debt.</p>
