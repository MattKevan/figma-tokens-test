* A simple research method that doesn’t need customer input
* It’s a method to review other websites or products which are either direct or indirect competitors.

Beware of copying what others are doing without understanding how it could help the users you are designing for.

### Objectives

* Understand how best in class websites, products or systems solve the same problems
* To understand what are these sites doing well that we can emulate?
* To understand what are these sites not doing well that we can improve upon?
* What conventions have been established that we need to follow?

### Method

* Gather 8-10 competitors
* Direct competitors but also indirect competitors who are solving a similar problem in another space
* Document positive features, Copy, layout of element, and flow
* Document negative elements that you can improve upon.
* Clearly document screen shots with annotations. Include a summary of findings.
* Write annotations in a way that they can stand on their own.
