## Activities you should do

**Hold a retrospective.** This is where you reflect with your team on what worked and what didn’t, and make plans for future improvements.

**Track performance.** Keep track of your project's performance, measuring it against the KPIs you developed at the start of the project. 

Share the results with your team and the wider business. If they're good, celebrate your work. If they're not so good, share your learnings along with recommendations – maybe others can avoid making the same mistakes.

## Activities you could do

**Plan the next phase.** It's likely you had to cut the scope to the bone to get the project launched, and there's still lots of things that you and the team would like to add. 

Don't leave these ideas languishing on a Trello board somewhere. Plan in when you're going to return to the project, adding missing features and paying back technical and design debt.
