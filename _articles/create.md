### Activities you should do

* Design the flow in high fidelity
* Use the AO design system: try reusing, evolving or merging existing patterns before introducing new patterns – when in doubt, talk to the team
* Follow the fundamentals of good interaction design
* Use real content, avoid placeholders as much as possible
* Think about the system (including content and design) holistically – consider how the product changes if you make any changes within the system
* Discuss your proposal with other teams who might be impacted by it
* Don't just design the happy path, consider all states and edge cases
* Consider how users will experience your design and content for the first time
* Share your designs with the UX team for feedback.
* Share designs with stakeholders and get sign-off if required.

### Activities you could do

* Create interactive prototypes
* Test the flow your users will go through (using Figma, Protopie etc.)
* Test detailed micro-interactions and transitions
* Write the content in the user experience based on the system concepts and content principles.
* Contribute or give feedback on our design system
* Do usability testing on your designs and prototypes with real customers and iterate based on feedback.



### Outcome

High fidelity designs/prototypes shared with engineers to start building.
