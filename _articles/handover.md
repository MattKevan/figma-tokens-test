## Goal

## Activities you should do

* Design the unhappy path: empty states, error and loading states, edge cases.
* Polish the visuals â€“ make it look beautiful and feel enjoyable.
* Make sure the content follows our principles, is concise and easy to understand.
* QA the built UI early and often, ensuring it's high quality and aligns with your design.
* Take ownership of what we will ship and fight for quality.
* Push for the best possible experience.
* Look to cut scope (but not quality) and be okay with some healthy tension.

## Activities you could do

* Design meaningful micro-interactions and transitions
* Sit with developers and work around tech challenges together
* Tweak your designs in the browser in response to technical challenges
* Create Trello/DevOps issues and ensure they are closed out before shipping
* Ensure our patterns and components are being used correctly or that you're feeding changes back into the design system
* Finalise the UI content and commission copywriting and translation where needed.
* Create a detailed QA plan with the team

## Outcome

Your design implemented in high quality and shipped.
