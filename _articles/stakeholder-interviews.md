# Stakeholder interviews

Gathering requirements and understanding outcomes.

Research can’t solely focus on the customer; we need to understand how it will be built and how the business will want to use it. 

We need to reach out to people within the business and talk to them about the product you are working on. 

Executives, Product, Technology, Customer support, Marketing, Sales, Trade etc..

Our aim with this research method is to understand the challenge in greater detail but also to get consensus about what we need to do.

It has elements of being a collaborative experience.  

We want to understand the technical feasibility of what we are trying to do. 
What are the step we need to take before we can start to make our ideas. 

If you are redesigning an existing product, you may want to find out how a the business is currently using it. What are the opportunities that it may be missing. 


## Who is a stakeholder?

* Anybody with a stake in the project.
* Anybody who feeds in requirements.
* Anybody who provides sign off.

## Interview objectives

* Understand the business goals
* Problems with the product

## Things to keep in mind

* Tailor the interview to the stakeholder you are talking with.
* Avoid talking about solutions
* Avoid talking about features
* Deflect, focus on goals and problems
* Keep high level
* Prepare a set of questions to ask
* The more prep you do up front, the more benefit these session will be
* Take notes

!!! tip
	Our aim is to reframe a question we have been given into a better question. Always ask “why?” and act dumb. 

## Example script

1. What is your role within [blank]? What are the objectives for you and your team? How do these objectives support the overall business objectives?
2. Does your team deal directly with customers, suppliers or other external stakeholders? If so, please describe the nature of the interaction.
3. Who is the target audience for [blank]’s website? Tell us about them.
4. What is your opinion of the current [blank] website? How does it help you achieve your objectives? How does it help customers achieve their objectives?
5. How does the [blank] website compare to those of your direct competitors and peers? What are your competitors/peers doing well that you would like to emulate?
6. What do you think could be [blank] competitive advantage in the online space? How could it use the web to differentiate itself?
7. How would you define success for the [blank] website? Would you be able to define specific goals or targets?
8. What is the biggest risk to the future success of the [blank] website? What are the biggest challenges [blank] faces in the online space?


This is a very general stakeholder interview. It is a good starting point, but you will need to change the question depending on the context and stakeholder you are interviewing. 

## Running the session as a workshop

Some projects you can run sessions like this as workshop with multiple stakeholders. [Rose, Bud, Thorn exercise](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase1-understand/rose-thorn-bud) is a great way to do this.
